{-| Routers may be nested. This function is useful in situations

{-| Render a path given a route and a list of route components.

    type Sitemap
      = HomeR ()
      | UsersR ()
      | UserR Int

    homeR = HomeR := static ""

    > reverse homeR []
    "/"

    > reverse usersR []
    "/users"

    > reverse userR ["1"]
    "/users/1"

If you are willing to write some boilerplate, this function can be used
to construct a reasonably-safe reverse routing function specific to your
application:

    render : Sitemap -> String
    render r =
      case r of
        HomeR () -> reverse homeR []
        UsersR () -> reverse usersR []
        UserR uid -> reverse userR [toString uid]

    > render (HomeR ())
    "/"

    > render (UsersR ())
    "/users"

    > render (UserR 1)
    "/users/1"

This function will crash at runtime if there is a mismatch between the
route and the list of arguments that is passed in. For example:

    > reverse deepR []
    Error: Ran into a `Debug.crash` in module `Route`

    This was caused by the `case` expression between lines 145 and 175.
    One of the branches ended with a crash and the following value got through:

        ([],[CInt,CInt,CInt])

    The message provided by the code author is:

        'reverse' called with an unexpected number of arguments

    > reverse deepR ["a"]
    Error: Ran into a `Debug.crash` in module `Route`

    This was caused by the `case` expression between lines 171 and 176.
    One of the branches ended with a crash and the following value got through:

        Err ("could not convert string 'a' to an Int")

    The message provided by the code author is:

        could not convert string 'a' to an Int in a call to 'reverse'
